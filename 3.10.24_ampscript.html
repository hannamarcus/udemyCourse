<!--Write a script for an email campaign that sends a follow-up survey to attendees after an event. Assume you have a data extension named EventAttendees with columns SubscriberKey, EventName, EventDate, and Attended (a boolean indicating whether they attended). The script should check if the event date was within the past 7 days and if the attendee marked as Attended. If both conditions are true, send an email with a link to a survey about their event experience.
