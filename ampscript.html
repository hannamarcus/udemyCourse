<!-- AMPscript Challenge: Personalized Discount Offer Based on Purchase History

Write a script for an email campaign that offers personalized discounts to customers based on their total purchase
amount in the last year. Assume you have a data extension named PurchaseHistory with columns SubscriberKey,
PurchaseDate, and PurchaseAmount. Customers who spent over $1000 should receive a 20% discount offer, those who spent
between $500 and $1000 should receive a 15% discount, and those who spent less than $500 should receive a 10% discount. -->
